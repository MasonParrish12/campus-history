## Introduction

The University of New Mexico Press has been a fixture of UNM for nearly a century. Compared to many other long-standing institutions on campus, though, the Press has been shifted between many different locations over the years. Currently, it is based out of 1717 Roma Avenue NE, to the west of Dane Smith Hall; this building was first constructed as the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house. The Press occupies the first floor and basement of the building, with one office on the upper level (the rest are reserved for overflow from Scholes Hall across the street and to the east). The Press is New Mexico's one major book publisher and handles various regional projects, as well as scholarly books alongside poetry collections and fiction. Its history is long and storied, and, as far as becoming part of UNM goes, properly begins in 1929—incidentally, the same year that the ball got rolling for the construction of its current base of operations.

## Origins of the Press

Even though it would not be until the fall of 2009 that the Press would come to be housed within 1717 Roma, both may not have existed if not for the efforts of UNM President James Fulton Zimmerman. It was Zimmerman who encouraged the building program for fraternities and sororities, which manifested as a subdivision on Roma named Sorority Row, and he was also the figure who brought the Press to campus. On June 1st, 1929, UNM's Board of Regents unanimously approved the establishment of the Press. However, the Press was not started from scratch. A conglomerate of organizations based in Santa Fe—the Museum of New Mexico, the School of American Research, the Historical Society of New Mexico, the New Mexico Archaeological Society, and the New Mexico Geographical Society—had previously banded together to establish the El Palacio Press, which published the periodical _El Palacio_. _El Palacio_ began life as a monthly publication that covered scientific, literary, and art news of the Spanish Southwest, and it soon became the first weekly publication devoted to archaeology and museum activities. It was first published in November 1913 and was based inside the Palace of the Governors, whose name it was derived from. Dr. Zimmerman entered into a cooperative agreement with the director of the Museum of New Mexico and the School of American Research, Dr. Edgar L. Hewett, which meant that the entire Press was transplanted from Santa Fe to UNM in 1930. On July 15th, Paul A. F. Walter, Jr. was hired as the assistant director for both the Museum of New Mexico and the School of American Research, as well as the director of publications at UNM. The first equipment was moved over sometime in August or September of that year. The press's name initially remained El Palacio Press, but as people increasingly referred to it as the University of New Mexico's press, the name stuck. At the time the UNM Press began operations, it was the only one located between the University of Oklahoma and the West Coast.

### The First Location of the Press

In a similar vein, the first building the Press was housed in was already established. In the summer of 1921, Mrs. Jacob Korber and her son A.P. Korber gifted UNM $500 to pay for equipment for a wireless telephone and telegraph station. It conducted its first radio broadcast on December 16th, 1921. While it was initially based in the Science Hall, in 1925, two small buildings were built for the Station. UNM had high hopes for the Korber Wireless Station, proudly boasting that its towers would be "destined to be of great service to this region." It closed the very next year because it was too expensive to operate. 

After that, one of the buildings was reappropriated as a music studio for a short time, before the Press ultimately ended up inhabiting both of them. At the time, the buildings were connected by an outdoor boardwalk. In 1934, the Buildings and Grounds Department was able to double the size of the Press by removing the shared walls between the two buildings and constructing a roof over them both. The resulting structure was joined to Carlisle Gym and still stands to this day. It was further expanded in 1938, when Professor William E. Burk of the School of Architecture donated his services to both double the space within the building once again and to remodel it in the Pueblo Revival style. The US government's Works Progress Administration helped make this possible. The Press occupied the building until 1949, with the editorial offices moving to a building close by that has since been replaced with Clark Hall. The former Korber Radio Station buildings would come to house the Office of Veterans' Affairs and the Counseling and Testing Division, and remain standing to this day as a facilities management structure.

If one looks closely, they can see lines in the stucco to the right of the door that appear to match with where a window originally was, complete with it being taller than the door itself, and one level to the ground that seems to match with the originally raised entrance walkway; it is likely this is the exact same side of the building."

### Early Press Operations
For its first 3 years, the Press was little more than a printing facility for UNM. UNM had conducted some publishing prior to the establishment of the Press, including catalogs, internal materials, and some booklets, from 1898 onward. Their first ever booklet publication was published under the auspices of the "Hadley Climatological Laboratory" and was titled "Physiological Corrolaries of Equilibrium Theory of Nervous Action and Control." At first, the Press's output was largely comprised of similar material. Its first publications were pamphlets, while it also published booklets in the Bulletins series. Their equipment, though, was used to print works for UNM staff and other individuals, and some of these were credited to the Press. Technically, their first-ever hardcover book release was _Givers of Life_ by Emma Esterbook, which was published in 1931. However, the Press does not classify it as their first release because they did not advertise, distribute, or catalog it themselves. Their first true release was _New Mexico History and Civics_ by Lansing B. Bloom and Thomas C. Donnelly (the future president of New Mexico Highlands University) in 1933. This was also the year that Fred E. Harvey was hired as the Press Director.

Between 1933 and 1943, the Press published 56 total books. Book publishing wasn't a focus of the Press at first, as they were busy handling the catalogues for UNM and its graduate school, as well as an increasing number of bulletins. They leased their machinery and equipment from the School of American Research until 1935, when the Press acquired it for $5,000. Additionally, as part of UNM, plans were made for a University literary publication with a distinctly Southwestern flavor, in the form of the _New Mexico Quarterly._
